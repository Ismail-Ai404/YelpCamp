## üõ†Ô∏è About YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application where users can *create*, *browse*, and *review* campgrounds. To submit campsites or reviews, users must register and log in. This project was developed as part of **Colt Steele‚Äôs Web Developer Bootcamp** on Udemy.

## üß© Functionalities

- Anyone can **view** all campgrounds and read reviews without signing up or logging in.  
- Registered users can **create** new campgrounds and add reviews.  
- Users must log in to **edit** or **delete** campgrounds or comments they‚Äôve created.  
- Users cannot modify or delete other users‚Äô content.  
- All data is persistent: campground info, user accounts, reviews are stored in the cloud (AWS + MongoDB), so nothing is lost between sessions.
